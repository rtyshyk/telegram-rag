Given the following conversation and a follow up input, rephrase the follow up into a SHORT, standalone query (which captures any relevant context from previous messages) for a vectorstore.
IMPORTANT: EDIT THE QUERY TO BE AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE. Respond with a short, compressed phrase with mainly keywords instead of a complete sentence.
If there is a clear change in topic, disregard the previous messages.
Strip out any information that is not relevant for the retrieval task.
If the follow up message is an error or code snippet, repeat the same input back EXACTLY.
