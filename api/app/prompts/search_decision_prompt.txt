Given the conversation history and a follow up query, determine if the system should call an external search tool to better answer the latest user input.
Your default response is YES_SEARCH.

Respond "SKIP_SEARCH" if either:
- There is sufficient information in chat history to FULLY and ACCURATELY answer the query AND additional information or details would provide little or no value.
- The query is some form of request that does not require additional information to handle.

Conversation History:
---
{chat_history}

If you are at all unsure, respond with YES_SEARCH.
Respond with EXACTLY and ONLY "YES_SEARCH" or "SKIP_SEARCH"

Follow Up Input:
{question}
